Viewable (here)[https://viz.diffusecreation.com]

Current Bootstrap Theme: (Litera)[https://bootswatch.com/litera/].  See bootswatch.com for other easy to use themes.

* Running Locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`, `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

## TODO:
* Favicon
* Get Homepage links into (cards)[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/]
* complete histogram
* Fit colorscheme to something we like! (Or maybe change theme)
* Build slider over raw
* Switch to a (react)[https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages] app
* build a line chart n_feedings, total_feeding_duration vs time

## Chart Ideas:
* Spectrogram using voice of viewer
  dial adjusting tradeoff between frequency and time resolution
* box of (radio) waves in 3d
* leverage [this](https://observablehq.com/@d3/versor-dragging) or the transparent version to plot corona virus cases over time
